Hi, I’m Vilsee Kumar Shandilya.

I work on applied machine learning and data-driven systems, with a focus on building reliable, interpretable, and real-world ML solutions. My interests sit at the intersection of machine learning, data infrastructure, and responsible technology.

Currently, I’m focused on:
- End-to-end machine learning pipelines (data ingestion → modeling → evaluation)
- Applied ML using Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
- Model evaluation, feature analysis, and interpretability
- Cloud-integrated ML workflows using AWS and Google Cloud

Selected projects:
- **Medical Malpractice Claim Predictor** — ensemble-based ML system for structured risk prediction  
  https://github.com/vilsee/Medical-Malpractice-Claim-Predictor
- **SimplifyThis** — NLP-based text understanding and simplification tool  
  https://github.com/vilsee/SimplifyThis
- **ML Health Risk Pipeline** — production-style ML workflow with preprocessing, training, and evaluation  
  (in progress)

I’m particularly interested in how machine learning systems interact with regulation, ethics, and real-world constraints, and how responsible system design can scale in production environments.
